  title: Flyer's Bossier Modules
  author: VFlyer
  description: '[i]The term "boss module" is used to describe a module that requires
    taking extensive notes; and require inputs, usually at the very end, or in-between
    each solve. I never thought he would make modules so complicated, it would take
    him nearly a year to finish, and attempt. Maybe that''s supposed to be good since
    it allows him to "warm up to be a master."[/i]


    Currently contains 2 modules developed by VFlyer, consisting some ideas from other
    users.


    The following module ideas come from their respective authors of the original
    idea:
