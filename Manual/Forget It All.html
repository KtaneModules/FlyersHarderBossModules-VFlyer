                    <h2>On the Subject of Forget It All</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">If you do not remember where you have been, does it even help to figure out where you are going?</p>
                    <p>This module consists of 6 buttons with an LED attached to the center of the button, and 2 displays, one long display that may display a name of a module, another that displays the stage counter.</p>
                    <p>Under normal circumstances, the stage counter will start at 1 and some of the LEDs may be lit.</p>
                    <p>When a <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=ForgetItAll">non-ignored module</a> is solved after a short amount of time, the stage counter will increment and a new set of LEDs will be shown. For each stage, take note of which LEDs were ON and which module caused the stage to change (i.e., the first solved module will correspond to the first stage).</p>
                    <p>When all other modules have been solved, the number display will show how many correct presses in the expected sequence over 10, and all of the LEDs will be shut off. That means that the module is ready to be solved. Obtain the necessary sequence of presses needed to disarm this module. Pressing an incorrect button in that sequence or before the module is ready to solve will cause a strike.</p>
					<h3>Calculating the Sequence To Press</h3>
					<p>When the module is ready to be solved, for each LED, count the number of stages in which it was ON (see Interpreting Tampered LEDs to determine LEDs that were modified) and multiply by its multiplier, as seen in the table below. Sum all of the obtained LED values, and if the sum is not between 1 and the number of stages, add or subtract the number of stages until it is. This number will be the first key stage.</p>
					<h3>Pressing Buttons</h3>
					<p>Using the table below, translate each character, of the module’s name corresponding to the key stage into a color. If a character corresponding to the module’s name does not correspond to a color, skip to the next character if there are more. If the sequence of colors has fewer than 10 colors, repeat that sequence by duplicating itself, until it has 10 or more colors. Tak the first 10 colors of the sequence. If there are no colors in relation to the translated module’s name, use the next stage as the key stage, wrapping to the first stage if on the last stage, until you obtain a sequence of colors, or you loop back to the first key stage, without a sequence of colors. If the expert is unable to obtain a sequence of colors upon looping back to the first key stage, refer to the special cases.</p>

					<h3>Interpreting Tampered LEDs</h3>
					<p>For each stage, use the table below and the name of module that caused it to change to the next stage to identify which LEDs were tampered that stage. Consider each ON tampered LED as if it was OFF, and vice-versa.</p>
					<p>An LED is tampered for a specific stage if the corresponding module’s name contains any of the words in the respective row in the table below. For example, if the module's name is "Complicated Wires" for one of the stages and the LEDs were Orange and Purple, the final LEDs would be Red, Orange, Purple, and Yellow. If there are multiple instances of one set of words for one color, toggle the LED as many times as that many instances.</p>
