                    <p class="flavour-text">Where are you pointing at?</p>
                    <p>The module consists of a 6 by 6 grid filled with arrows in different colors and orientations.</p>
                    <p>In the beginning, a single arrow will glow. This will be your starting position. Of the arrows displayed, write down all of their orientations and colors. After a <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=Pointer%20Pointer">non-ignored module</a> is solved, all arrows from the illustration will be hidden. Using the illustration from the arrows previously, move 1 step in the true direction of the arrow where the defuser is on, until you encounter a tile twice, looping to the other side if the arrow the defuser is on is not pointing on a tile. The tile that is encountered twice will be the correct tile. Consider the starting tile to be initially encountered. If the tile selected is correct, the LEDs surrounding the grid will flash green, and you would be able to continue to solve modules without problem. If the tile is incorrect, or a non-ignored module is solved while this module is not answered, the LEDs surrounding the grid will flash red and a strike will occur.</p>
                    <p>After answering correctly, a new set of arrows will appear with different colors and orientations. Perform the same step that was performed in the beginning, except with the starting cell, the cell that was first visited twice on the last stage, until all the non-ignored modules has been solved. In this case, answering correctly for the last time will disarm this module.</p>
                    <p>If at any point the module strikes by pressing an incorrect cell, or by solving a module while the grid of arrows is hidden, the module will reveal the arrows that was shown before the grid was hidden, and glow the starting arrow that was assigned on that stage.</p>
