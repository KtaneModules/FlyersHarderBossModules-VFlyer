                <h2>On the Subject of Clearance Code</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You are nested with so much protection. Do you feel stressed out now?</p>
                <p>The module consists of 10 buttons numbered 0-9 in a circular position, and a display in the center of the buttons.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the module, 4 buttons will light up.
                    Buttons that are lit up will have their texts in black and their buttons in white, and vice versa.
                    Starting from the top button and moving clockwise, create a 4 digit number using the digits in the lit buttons.
                    The first lit button will be the first digit, the second will be the second, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    After a <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=clearanceCodeModule">non-ignored</a> module is solved, the buttons will randomize their positions and all the lit buttons will turn off.
                    Locate the new positions of the digits that you gathered.
                    Moving clockwise, calculate the distance of their initial positions and their current positions.
                    Add the distances to their respective digits.
                    If the result goes over nine, use the least significant digit.
                    After that, type the code that was calculated. This will become your “final code” for later stages.
                    If the code is correct, the lights beside the display will flash green, and you would be able to continue to solve modules without problem.
                    If the code is incorrect, or a non-ignored module was solved while this module is waiting for the correct code, the light beside the display will flash red and a strike will occur.
                    <strong>This stage must still be completed, otherwise more strikes will occur.</strong></p>
                <p>After inputting the first code correctly, a new set of 4 buttons will light up from the current arrangement of digits.
                    After adding the distances to each of the new digits, you will then need to subtract each digit of the resulting code for that stage by each digit of the “final code” of the previous stage, to make your “final code” for this stage, adding ten if a digit goes into the negatives. This procedure is repeated for all stages, with stages 3, 4, and every 4 stages after those with the initial digits on those stages gathered in the <strong>opposite direction.</strong></p>
                <p>Repeat until all the non-ignored modules have been solved. Inputting the code correctly one last time will disarm the module.</p>

                <p>If at any point this module strikes, the module will light up each pair of digits in color, one of which will be filled in and have black text, and the other will just be colored. If only one is colored, it will be paired by itself. Each pair of digits that light up in color correspond to the distance between the two, and the initial digit of the 4 digit number for this stage, if the digit was in black text, or its initial position otherwise.
                    The “final code” from the previous stage will be displayed as input, if there is a previous stage. The code can still be inputted as normal.</p>
                <h2>On the Modification of Clearance Code</h2>
                <p>There is only 1 setting for this module, which can be enabled: Easy Mode.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stage 1 can be done as normal.</li>
                    <li>For every stage afterwards, the final code for the previous stages can be discarded, as the defuser will need to input ONLY the result before the “final code” modifications.</li>
                    <li>To distinguish between easy mode and normal mode, the text color will always be in white in easy mode. Normal mode will alternate between cyan and magenta, respectively.</li>
                    <li>Initial digits obtained in all stages will ALWAYS be in clockwise order from top. This direction will <strong>NEVER</strong> change.</li>
