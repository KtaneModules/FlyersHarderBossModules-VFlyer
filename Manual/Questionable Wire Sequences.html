                    <h2>On the Subject of Questionable Wire Sequence</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">This is Wire Sequence? I have many questions about this.</p>
                    <p>The module will reveal a panel of at most 3 colored wires with a number on the top denoting the position of the digit by that wire. There is also left and right arrow buttons which are used to switch between panels alongside a square display between the arrow buttons will can safely be ignored. These wires are always single-colored for this instance. Besides tapping the left and right arrows buttons to go to the previous or next panels respectively, the defuser can hold the left arrow to go back to the first panel or the right arrow to go to the most recent incomplete panel. Using the 10 digit number on the right of the module,</p>
                    <p class="squeeze">From left to right, account for the number of times the given wire color has occurred and cut that wire if the digit in the position specified on the top screen is any of the given values in provided cell. "(any)" represents digits 0-9 for the expected digits; likewise "(none)" represents no digits. A strike will incur if a wire is cut when that wire should not be cut or if the defuser attempts to advance to the next panel when the module expects wires to cut on the current panel.</p>
