				<h2>The Super Boss: Defeating Manipulating Luck</h2>
				<p class="flavour-text">Nothing is simple. It just involves RNG being in the way again.
				</p>
				<p>This module will consist of a stage counter, 4 areas where the components will appear and disappear, and a timer just above the wider component area. To disarm the module, take note of as many stages as possible as well as the components that are shown on the module. Calculate the value needed to input from the individual sections provided. Then, perform the correct action ranging from cutting specific wires in order, entering digits on a keypad, or inputting similarly to The Sphere when the module requests to input. The module may randomly request an input early if none of the smaller components are revealed, so bare in mind when accounting for that.</p>
				<p>Inputting a calculated value incorrectly or letting the timer run out when the module requests an input while multiple solves are being processed will result in a strike.</p>
				<p>The smaller components range from a digit on the display, an LED, and a cube, which may rotate in a random direction.</p>

				<h2>Stage Generation Procedures</h2>
				<p>Each stage will be generated based on the number of non-ignored modules that are solved so far. The timer will count down at 15 seconds per stage that is currently shown and advance when the timer expires. By default, smaller components are randomly selected to be active or not active. However there are rules that can be applied to alter how the stages are generated.</p>
				<p>These following rules ALWAYS applies (Top-most rule takes highest priority, bottom-most rule takes lowest priority):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If there is exactly 1 non-ignored unsolved module left, that given stage must reveal at least 1 of the smaller components. Likewise, the next stage immediately after that will ALWAYS be the input procedure.</li>
					<li>The first 3 stages at the start will reveal exactly 1 of the smaller components.</li>
					<li>If module has revealed none of the smaller components for that given stage, the module will then request an early input. The next 4 stages generated after the current stage must reveal at least 1 of the smaller components. In the case of multiple solves being processed, a stage requiring early inputs will have a timer set for 2 minutes instead of 15 seconds. The timer may be extended by 15 seconds for every stage after the 8th requested stage.</li>
					<li>Other rules corresponding to this module are present however the defuser will need very specific modules present in order to trigger these corresponding rules.</li>

						<li><strong>Any Module:</strong> If previous stage was an input procedure and the solved module required another input procedure directly after that stage. SuperBoss will instead generate at least 1 component instead. THIS TAKES HIGHEST PRIORITY.</li>

						<li><strong>Forget Me Now:</strong> The next stage generated will only reveal the digit component if the previous input procedure involves the 10 digit keypad.</li>
						<li><strong>The Modkit:</strong> The next stage generated will reveal components based on what components are required in The Modkit.</li>

				<h2>Individual Stage Calculations: General Overview</h2>
				<p class="flavour-text">There's so much to prep for.</p>
				<p>In order to obtain the calculated value, the expert will need to find the page which only contains the specified components shown on that stage and refer to page on how to retrieve the calculated value. The expert may be required to relay the information back to the defuser. In addition, the defuser may need to read out the properties of the smaller components. If colorblind mode is enabled for SuperBoss, a letter will also be shown to denote the color of the LED if it's on, or no letters at all if it's off. This letter is the first letter of the given color, I.E. R for Red, O for Orange, etc. For clarity on the reading the cube on the module, all single "9"'s will be in <strong>bold text</strong> and all "6"'s will not.</p>

				<h2>Individual Stage Calculations: Floating Cube</h2>
				<p>If the smaller active components are not <strong>[ Cube ]</strong>, you are looking at the wrong page! <a href="#stagecalculations">Go back to General Overview for Individual Stage Calculations.</a></p>
				<p>The cube will show a unique digit from 1 to 6 on each face except for one face which will be referred to as the starting face. The cube will rotate to another face 1 to 3 times and then reverse its rotation to go back to the starting face.</p>
				<p>The calculated value is determined by adding up the digits the cube has rotated to as the new reference face (The original reference face is marked as "X"), subtracting the missing value, and then taking the absolute value of that result, modulo 10.</p>
				<p>As an example, take for instance the net of the cube where the "X" face is the top face:</p>
				<table class="center" style="width: auto">
					<tr>
						<td>1</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>X</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>2</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>6</td>
					</tr>

				<p>If the cube now rotates to show the top face numbered 5, and then rotates to show the top face numbered 6 before reversing the rotations, the sum from the referred faces is now 11. Since the replaced digit is a 3 according to the net, you would do 11 - 3 to get your calculated value of 8.</p>

				<h2>Input Procedures: General Overview</h2>
				<p>When the module successfully reveals no components or is ready to solve, the wider component will open up and reveal one of the three input methods that the defuser can interact with. Each of the provided pages underneath will provide different procedures that are required to disarm the module. If any inputs were incorrect for that stage, the module may reshow that given stage that was inputted incorrectly.</p>
				<p>The order of the inputs by default is by when each stage was shown and excluding previous correct sets if there are any. Some components revealed by the wider component may request a different stage that may be out of the standard order.</p>
				<p>If the defuser manages to input all of the requested stages correctly when the module successfully reveals no components, the module will clear all of the requested stages up to this input procedure and speeds up the timer if the timer has not ran out yet for this stage. Those stages that were inputted correctly will NOT be included in the final input procedure. If this is the final input procedure, the module will instead disarm itself instead.</p>

				<p>If the wider revealed component is not <strong>[ Wire Sequences ]</strong>, you are looking at the wrong page! <a href="#inputprocedure">Go back to General Overview for Input Procedures.</a></p>
				<p>The module will show 2 colored wires on each panel with a number on the left denoting the stage referenced by that wire. There is also an up and down arrow buttons on the right which are used to switch between panels alongside a 3rd display that displays a logic operator for that panel of wires. These wires may be multi-colored for this instance. The defuser can hold the up arrow to go back to the first panel or the down arrow to go to the most recent incomplete panel.</p>
				<p>Account for the number of times the given wire color has occurred based on and check if the calculated value for that stage displayed on the left is any of the given values in provided cell. Apply the operator on that wire and cut if the expression return true. Calculated Value will be referred to as CV for these tables provided. If at any case there are 13 or more occurrences of 1 wire color, wrap back to the top of the table and continue downwards from there. "(any)" represents "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9" for the CVs; likewise "(none)" represents "". Cutting a wire that does not need to be cut will result in a strike but it will not reshow that stage. However, attempting to advance to the next panel when at least 1 wire needs to be cut on the current panel will result in a strike while reshowing the stages based off of the displayed stages in that panel.</p>

				<h2>Input Procedures: The Unstoppable Floating Sphere</h2>
				<p>If the wider revealed component is not <strong>[ Sphere ]</strong>, you are looking at the wrong page! <a href="#inputprocedure">Go back to General Overview for Input Procedures.</a></p>
				<p>The sphere will emerge from the smaller component and expand once it is at the center of this module. The wider component will then reveal a screen consisting of the last 10 inputs, indicated by smaller spheres, on the left side of the wider component alongside a detailed input and a left arrow button on the right side of the module. The left arrow button can be used to delete the last input if the last input was done improperly. This cannot be done on the last requested stage's input.</p>
				<p>The detailed input on the right side will show 2 characters when interacting with the sphere with "T" denoting a tap, "H" denoting a hold, and a number to the right of that denoting the calculated value inputted. The smaller spheres will be colored dark cyan if the action was a hold and light green if the action was a tap.</p>
				<p>If for each stage, that stage has an odd number of components revealed, the calculated value from that stage must be inputted as a hold. Otherwise the calculated value must be inputted as a tap. The sphere will play a sound every time it glows to confirm.</p>
				<p>For each tap, tap the sphere when the last seconds digit is the calculated value, modulo 10, for that given stage. Likewise, for each hold, hold the module until the calculated value, modulo 10, is how long the sphere was held, based on the countdown timer. A 0 for that calculated value should actually be inputted as a 10 for those holds. Refer to <a href="The Sphere.html">The Sphere</a> for clarifications. These must be inputted in order by when these stages were obtained. Try not to hold for more than 10 timer ticks, otherwise the module WILL strike at a cost of deleting that input in the process.</p>
				<p>Failure to input all of the requested stages correctly with the correct actions will reshow all stages that were incorrect by hiding the sphere first, and then proceeding to reshow each stage that has its calculated value inputted incorrectly. Only reinput the stages that were shown again when the module is ready for input again.</p>
